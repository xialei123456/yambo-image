## Project Introduction

[Yambo](https://github.com/yambo-code/yambo) is a materials property prediction software based on many-body perturbation theory and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), which employs first-principles methods rooted in Green's function formalism to characterize the excited-state properties of real materials.

**Core Features:**

Yambo implements first-principles methods based on the Green's function formalism to describe the excited-state properties of real materials. These methods include the GW approximation, the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), electron-phonon interactions, and nonequilibrium Green's function theory (NEGF).
